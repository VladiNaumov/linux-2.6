#### Question
The tee command reads its standar input until end-of-file, writing a copy of 
the input to standard output and to the file named in its command-line 
argument. (We show an example of the use of this command hwne we discuss FIFOs 
in Section 44.7.) Implement tee using I/O system calls. By default, tee overwites
any existing file with the given name. Impelment the -a command-line option (tee 
-a file), which casuses te to append text to the end of a file if it already 
exists. (Refer to Appendix B for desription ofthe getopt() function, which can 
be used to parse command-line options.)
